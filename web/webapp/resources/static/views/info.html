<h5>This is quite a simple application utilizing Java/Spring MVC for the backend along with AngularJS for the frontend. There's actually nothing too fancy here though. What is going to be shown is actually a humble CRUD.</h5>
<p> <i>-Add a new brand.</i></p>
<p> <i>-You can later check the brands already created.</i></p>
<p> <i>-When you add the model you will have to choose some brands which were created before. Will not be possible to add a model without indicating the brand previously added.</i></p>
<p> <i>-Then you can see the models and check in which specific brand it was added.</i></p>
<p> <i>-After that, it's possible to add a car by choosing both a brand and a model that is registered in the database already.</i></p>
<p> <i>-There are options available to edit the records.</i></p>
<p> <i>-The fact that I'm not a native English speaker I really hope it's all clear enough.</i></p>
